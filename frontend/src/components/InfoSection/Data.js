    description: 'Do you remember those old fashioned photo prints of you which were taken by your parents during the days of film? Nothing feels better than holding these prints in your hands and reminiscing about some of the best memories of your life as years go by. Being a part of this digital age, we went from printing photos to storing them on smartphone or sharing them online. All too often, once stored, these photographs tend to get lost. Lost memories are expensive. We love the idea of a book, and we believe printing photos is the only way of bringing them back to life again. All we want is you to share real memories and experience the burst of happiness not only on your gadget, but in your hands.',

    description: 'We want to create a place people can use to capture the current moment and make a beautiful book that marks every chapter in your life, years and years. We want to provide a special home for your memories, a tangible way to relive them, bringing them to the physical world. Photobooks are solid, sturdy, sharable and enduring, capturing your special moment in something which you can share, keep or even physically touch and feel the memories you have taken. We do our part to revive the old fashioned idea of printing photos. Because we believe that there is absolutely no getting away from the fact that when you print photos you greatly feel the emotions of that instant in time as if it happened yesterday.',
